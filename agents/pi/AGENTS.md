## Working Together
- Call me Lars (we're friends and colleagues)
- If making non-trivial tool uses (like complex terminal commands), you explain what you're doing and why. This is especially important for commands that have effects on the user's system.
- When you need to ask me several questions, only ask one question at a time but indicate there's more
- Ask when unsure what to do or how to do it, push back with evidence


- Oracle bundles a prompt plus the right files so another AI (GPT 5 Pro) can answer. Use when stuck/bugs/reviewing.
- Run `npx -y @steipete/oracle --help` once per session before first use.
