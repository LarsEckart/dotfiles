description: BugMagnet - Comprehensive Test Coverage and Bug Discovery Workflow
---


Execute systematic test coverage analysis and implementation for a code module to discover edge cases and potential bugs.

## Usage
```
/bugmagnet <implementation-file-path>
```

Examples:
```
/bugmagnet lib/script/src/module-name.js
/bugmagnet src/main/java/com/example/Service.java
/bugmagnet src/calculator.py
/bugmagnet pkg/handler/processor.go
```

The language and testing framework will be auto-detected from the file extension and project structure.

## Workflow

At the end of each phase, pause and wait for user input or confirmation to proceed

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis

1. **Detect language and testing conventions**:
   - Determine language from file extension
   - Scan project to identify testing framework and conventions
   - Adapt all subsequent steps to use appropriate syntax and patterns for this language/framework

2. **Read the implementation file** to understand:
   - Public API (functions, methods, classes, interfaces)
   - Input parameters and their types
   - Internal state management
   - Dependencies and imported modules
   - Any referenced files in the same project (you may read these to understand context)

3. **Locate the test file**:
   - Search for corresponding test file using project conventions
   - If no test file exists, ask user if one should be created

4. **Check for code coverage tools**:
   - Look for coverage configuration in project (coverage config files, test scripts with coverage flags)
   - Common tools: coverage.py (Python), JaCoCo/Cobertura (Java), jest coverage/nyc/istanbul (JavaScript), SimpleCov (Ruby), go test -cover (Go)
   - If coverage tool exists, run it to get baseline coverage report
   - Note current coverage percentages and uncovered lines/branches
   - This will help identify gaps in Phase 2

5. **Read existing tests** to understand:
   - Current test coverage across different types:
     - **Statement coverage**: Which lines of code are executed
     - **Decision/branch coverage**: Which if/else branches are taken
     - **Condition coverage**: Each boolean sub-expression (true/false)
     - **Loop coverage**: Zero iterations, one iteration, multiple iterations, maximum iterations
     - **Expression evaluation coverage**: Short-circuit evaluation in complex expressions (&&, ||)
   - Testing patterns and assertion syntax used
   - Mock/stub strategies
   - Test organization (suite grouping, setup patterns)
   - Existing edge cases covered

6. **Check for project-specific testing guidelines**:
   - Look for README.md, README.txt, CONTRIBUTING.md, CONTRIBUTING.txt in project root
   - If found, scan for architecture-specific testing patterns (e.g., hexagonal architecture, frontend patterns, mocking strategies)
   - Adapt all subsequent testing to follow project conventions

7. **Ask user about additional context**:
   - "Are there any additional files I should review (e.g., requirements docs, roadmaps, design docs)?"
   - STOP and wait for an answer
   - If user provides file paths, read and analyze them

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis

8. **Evaluate missing test coverage** by analyzing what's currently tested vs what should be tested. Review the **Common Edge Case Checklist** (at end of document) and identify gaps in:
   - **Boundary conditions**: empty/null inputs, zero, extreme values, size limits
   - **Error paths**: invalid inputs, error messages, error propagation, error context preservation
   - **State transitions**: before/after changes, invalid transitions, reset behavior
   - **Complex interactions**: multiple features together, deep nesting, property conflicts and precedence
   - **Domain-specific edge cases**: names, emails, URLs, dates/times, currency, geographic data, file paths, security patterns
   - **Violated domain constraints**: implicit assumptions about uniqueness, mandatory fields, relationships, ordering, ranges, state, format, temporal ordering
   - **Multiple/related parameters**: same values, very close values, interdependencies
   - **Documentation/requirements**: any listed requirements or edge cases not tested

   **Refer to the detailed Common Edge Case Checklist** for comprehensive coverage categories based on parameter types.

9. **Categorize missing tests** by priority:
   - **High Priority**: Core functionality gaps, error handling, boundary conditions
   - **Medium Priority**: Complex interactions, multi-step scenarios, state management
   - **Low Priority**: Rare edge cases, performance-specific tests

10. **Present analysis to user**:
   - List missing test categories with specific examples
   - STOP and ask the user if all tests should be implemented, or if the user wants to skip some of them

11. **Clarify undecided behaviour**:
   - For any identified gaps with unclear expected behaviour, prompt the user to explain or decide the expected behaviour so you can use it in the next phase

### Phase 3: Iterative Test Implementation
12. **Write tests one at a time**:
   - Pick highest priority test from the list
   - Add gap tests to existing test suites based on the flow or method they are testing
   - Write a single test (or small group of 2-3 related tests)
   - **Name test to describe the outcome, not the action**:
     - Format: "returns X when Y", "throws error when Z"
     - ✅ GOOD: "returns chunks without error when text contains newlines"
     - ❌ BAD: "handles newline characters"
   - **CRITICAL: Ensure assertions match the test title**
     - If testing "allows creating objects with different properties", assert the actual property values
     - If testing "preserves order", check the actual order of elements
     - If testing "applies transformation X", verify the transformation result directly
     - Avoid indirect checks (e.g., checking length when you should check actual values)
   - Use complete equality assertions with full expected values
   - Avoid partial string matching for short strings - check whole output
   - Follow arrange-act-assert structure clearly
   - Run the test immediately

13. **Handle test failures**:
   - If test fails, analyze the actual vs expected output
   - Determine if:
     - **Test expectation is wrong**: Update test to match actual behavior
     - **Bug discovered**: Create skipped test with bug documentation
     - **Need more context**: Try 2 more variations with different approaches
   - **When you discover something surprising**:
     - Explore the surrounding territory with additional tests
     - Bugs often cluster together - test similar scenarios
     - Try variations of the same input pattern
     - Test inverse/opposite operations

14. **Document bugs in skipped tests**:
    - Use framework's skip/ignore mechanism
    - Mark test name with "- BUG" suffix
    - Include comprehensive comment with:
      - Brief description of what's broken
      - Root cause analysis
      - Code location (file path and line number)
      - Current problematic code snippet
      - Proposed fix with code
      - Expected vs actual output
    - Keep the failing assertion in the test body

15. **When a bug is discovered**:
    - **Try to create a minimal reproduction test**
    - Isolate the bug to the smallest possible test case
    - If the bug seems to be in a dependency/nested component:
      - Create tests for that component (within the same project only)
      - Do NOT cross project boundaries to external dependencies
      - Write tests in the appropriate test file for that component
    - Ask yourself: "What's the simplest way to expose this bug?"
    - Document the minimal reproduction in the skipped test
    - DO NOT IMPLEMENT FIXES OR CHANGE THE IMPLEMENTATION FILE, ONLY WRITE TESTS

16. **Maximum 3 attempts per test**:
    - If can't get test passing in 3 tries, document and move on
    - Create skipped test with analysis
    - Continue with next test category

17. **Mark progress after each passing test**:
    - Confirm test passes
    - Move to next test in the list
    - Update user on progress

18. **Ask the user if they want to perform advanced coverage**:
    - STOP and ask the user for confirmation to proceed to additional tests in phase 4

### Phase 4: Advanced Coverage

**Use the Common Edge Case Checklist** (at end of document) as your comprehensive reference for this phase. The checklist provides detailed examples and specific test cases organized by category.

19. **Create a separate test suite inside the primary test file**:
    - Check if "exploratory tests", "edge cases" or "bugmagnet session" test suite exists
    - If yes, use it
    - If not, create a new one with the name "bugmagnet session <current date>"
    - Add all tests created in phase 4 there, not in the primary test sections

20. **Test complex interactions** (if applicable):
    - See checklist: **For Complex Interactions**
    - Multiple features used together, three-way interactions, property/option precedence and override behavior
    - State changes across multiple operations, deep nesting, property conflicts

21. **Test error handling comprehensively**:
    - See checklist: **For Error Conditions**
    - Invalid property values with specific error messages, error context preservation (line numbers, file names)
    - Multiple errors in sequence, errors don't crash or prevent subsequent operations
    - Edge case inputs that should trigger errors (invalid types, out of range, malformed data)

22. **Test numeric edge cases** (where applicable):
    - See checklist: **For Functions Taking Numbers**, **For Size/Length Boundaries**, **For Currency/Financial Numbers**
    - Zero (various representations and contexts), numbers close to zero, negative numbers, very large/small numbers
    - Special floating point values (NaN, Infinity), scientific notation, formatted numbers
    - 32/64-bit boundaries, powers of 2
    - Currency: varying decimal places by currency, locale-specific formatting, rounding rules

23. **Test date/time edge cases** (where applicable):
    - See checklist: **For Date/Time Values**
    - Leap seconds, leap years (including century boundaries), invalid dates
    - DST transitions (duplicate times, missing times, regional differences)
    - Time zones, 32-bit system limits (before 1970, after 2038)
    - Calendar vs duration arithmetic, date/time format parsing (multiple formats, ambiguous formats, locale-specific)
    - Timeouts (operation, network, response)
    - Time synchronization (clock differences, drift, skew)

24. **Test string edge cases** (where applicable):
    - See checklist: **For Functions Taking Strings**, **For Internationalized Text**
    - Empty, single character, very long strings (10000+ chars)
    - Whitespace-only, mixed whitespace, long leading/trailing spaces
    - Unicode: directional control characters, special characters (ß, Turkish İ/i), combining characters
    - Invalid combinations, invisible characters (zero-width), emoji complexity (skin tones, ZWJ sequences)
    - Homograph attacks, multiple representations (precomposed vs combining)
    - Case transformation edge cases, regional indicators (flag emoji)
    - Text size boundaries (127/128, 255/256 bytes, 32KB, 64KB)

25. **Test collection edge cases** (where applicable):
    - See checklist: **For Functions Taking Collections (Arrays/Lists)**, **For Functions Taking Objects/Structures/Maps**
    - Empty, single element, many elements (100+), duplicate elements
    - Nested structures (deep nesting 5+ levels), circular references
    - Objects with extra/missing properties, deeply nested objects

26. **Test state transition edge cases** (where applicable):
    - See checklist: **For Stateful Operations**
    - Repeating same action multiple times, sequential actions in reverse order
    - Sequential actions out of order/different order
    - Executing one action multiple times within a sequence

27. **Test domain-specific edge cases** (where applicable based on parameter types):
    - See checklist: **For Functions Taking Names**, **For Functions Taking Email Addresses**, **For Functions Taking URLs**, **For Functions Taking Geographic Data**, **For User Input with Security Implications**, **For File Paths and File System Operations**
    - **Names**: Single character, very long (35-64 chars), extremely long, punctuation, accents, non-Latin scripts, mononymic names, reserved words ("Null", "Test"), multiple middle names, fictional/brand names, name changes
    - **Email addresses**: Valid formats (subdomain, plus addressing, IP addresses), internationalized domains, invalid formats
    - **URLs**: With/without protocols, ports, paths, internationalized domains, invalid formats
    - **Geographic data**: Single-letter city names, very long place names (58+ chars), special characters, various postal code formats (3-10 digits), postal codes optional in some countries, format changes over time, regional differences

    - **File paths**: Path length boundaries (260 Windows, 4096 Linux/Mac), special characters, reserved filenames, file existence, file system state (no space, read-only), file availability (locked, unavailable), file integrity (corrupted, empty), path separators

28. **Test violated domain constraints** (implicit assumptions):
    - See checklist: **For Violated Domain Constraints (Implicit Assumptions)**
    - Code often makes assumptions about data that aren't explicitly validated
    - **Uniqueness violations**: Duplicate IDs, usernames, keys where uniqueness assumed

    - **Format violations**: Data in unexpected format, wrong encoding, missing/extra structure
    - **Temporal violations**: End before start, creation after modification, future timestamps, expired dates for active items

### Phase 5: Summary and Documentation

29. **Provide comprehensive summary**:
    - Total tests added (by category)
    - Total passing/skipped tests
    - Key findings about behavior
    - List of discovered bugs with locations

30. **Document bugs separately**:
    - Create bug summary with:
      - Root cause analysis
      - Exact file and line numbers
      - Proposed fixes
      - Impact assessment
    - Include both expected and actual behavior

## Best Practices

### Test Writing Guidelines
- **Use descriptive test names**: Clear description of what behavior is tested
- **Test names describe outcomes, not actions**:
  - Format: "returns X when Y", "throws error when Z"
  - ✅ GOOD: "returns chunks without error when text contains newlines"
  - ❌ BAD: "handles newline characters"
- **Assertions must match the test title**:
  - ❌ BAD: Test titled "creates objects with different IDs" but only checks count/length
  - ✅ GOOD: Test titled "creates objects with different IDs" and actually verifies the IDs differ
  - ❌ BAD: Test titled "applies correct transformation" but only checks result is truthy
  - ✅ GOOD: Test titled "applies correct transformation" and checks the actual transformed values
  - **Always verify the specific property/behavior mentioned in the test name**
- **Specific value assertions over type checks**:
  - ✅ GOOD: `assert result.chunks equals ['First.', ' Second.']`
  - ❌ BAD: `assert result.chunks.length > 1`
  - ✅ GOOD: `assert result equals {chunks: ['text'], context: {line: 10}, properties: {}, error: null}`
  - ❌ BAD: `assert result has property 'chunks'`
  - Expect specific values, NOT just type checks or vague assertions
- **One assertion per concept**: Test one thing clearly
- **Full comparisons**: Use complete expected values, not partial matches
  - Exception: For large objects, match specific intention-revealing properties
  - Exception: For long strings, match intention-revealing substrings
- **Avoid magic values**: Use clear, readable test data
- **Group related tests**: Use nested test suites/groups
- **Test the happy path first**: Then add edge cases and error cases

### Test Structure Guidelines
- **Arrange-Act-Assert flow**: Clearly separate test setup, execution, and verification
- **Consistent naming**: Use clear names like `underTest`, `result`, `actual` for test subjects
- **Setup patterns**: Create test subject and wire mocks in setup blocks. Avoid unnecessary recreation
- **Grouping tests**: Group 3+ tests with common setup using nested test suites
- **Consolidate nested suites**: If 3+ nested suites share setup, create parent suite
- **Inline simple initialization**: For trivial setup, inline with assertion
- **Test order**: Test usual/happy path scenarios first, then edge cases, then error cases

### Bug Discovery Guidelines
- **Bugs cluster together**: When you find one bug, look for similar bugs nearby
  - If a function fails for one edge case, try related edge cases
  - If a property is handled incorrectly, check other similar properties
  - If behavior is wrong in one context, test it in related contexts
- **Create minimal reproductions**:
  - Strip away unnecessary setup
  - Use the simplest possible input that exposes the bug
  - Isolate to the smallest component that exhibits the problem
- **Test dependencies within the project**:
  - If bug seems to be in a helper/utility, test that directly
  - Create tests in the appropriate file for that component
  - Do NOT test external dependencies (npm packages, etc.)

### Bug Documentation
- **Always include expected vs actual**: Show what should happen
- **Provide code location**: File path and line number
- **Suggest a fix**: Don't just identify, propose solution
- **Explain root cause**: Help developers understand why
- **Mark test name with - BUG**: Makes it easy to find

### Running Tests
- **Run after each test**: Don't batch multiple untested changes
- **Run specific test file**: Run only the file being modified when possible
- **Fix failures immediately**: Don't accumulate broken tests
- **Maximum 3 attempts**: Move on if stuck

### Reading Project Files
- **You may read any files in the same project**: To understand implementation
- **Do not read external dependencies**: Stay within project boundaries
- **Read imported modules**: To understand behavior and contracts
- **Read configuration files**: To understand valid values and constraints

## Example Test Patterns

**Note:** These examples use JavaScript/Jest syntax for illustration. Treat them as pseudo-code and adapt to your language and testing framework's conventions.

### Basic Test (Good Assertions)
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Test says "sets username" but only checks object exists
test('sets username correctly', () => {
    const user = createUser({username: 'alice'});
    expect(user).toBeDefined();
});

// ✅ GOOD: Actually checks the username
test('sets username correctly', () => {
    const user = createUser({username: 'alice'});
    expect(user.username).toEqual('alice');
});
```

### Testing Actual Values Not Just Counts
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Test says "creates items with different IDs" but only checks count
test('creates items with different IDs', () => {
    const items = createMultipleItems(['a', 'b']);
    expect(items.length).toEqual(2);
});

// ✅ GOOD: Actually verifies the IDs are different
test('creates items with different IDs', () => {
    const items = createMultipleItems(['a', 'b']);
    expect(items[0].id).not.toEqual(items[1].id);
    expect(items[0].name).toEqual('a');
    expect(items[1].name).toEqual('b');
});
```

### Boundary Condition Test
```javascript
test('handles empty input correctly', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.operation('');

    expect(result).toEqual(expectedOutputForEmptyString);
});

test('handles very long input', () => {
    const longString = 'x'.repeat(10000);
    const result = moduleUnderTest.operation(longString);

    expect(result.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(result).not.toContain('error');
});
```

### Exploring Bug Clusters
```javascript
// You find this bug:
test.skip('fails to handle negative index - BUG', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.getItemAt(-1);
    expect(result).toEqual(lastItem);
    // Actual: undefined
});

// Explore similar territory:
test('handles index zero', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.getItemAt(0);
    expect(result).toEqual(firstItem);
});

test('handles index beyond array length', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.getItemAt(1000);
    expect(result).toBeUndefined();
});

test('handles non-integer index', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.getItemAt(1.5);
    expect(result).toEqual(secondItem); // or error?
});
```

### Minimal Bug Reproduction
```javascript
// Original complex test that exposed bug:
test.skip('complex scenario fails - BUG', () => {
    setup();
    operation1();
    operation2();
    const result = operation3();
    expect(result).toEqual(expected); // Fails
});

// Minimal reproduction:
test.skip('operation3 returns wrong value - BUG', () => {
    const result = operation3();
    expect(result).toEqual(expected); // Fails
    // Actual: wrongValue
    // Even without operation1 and operation2, this fails
});
```

### Numeric Edge Case Tests
```javascript
test('handles zero correctly', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.calculate(0);
    expect(result).toEqual(0);
});

test('handles negative numbers', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.calculate(-5);
    expect(result).toEqual(expectedNegativeResult);
});

test('handles very large numbers', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.calculate(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
});
```

### Collection Edge Cases
```javascript
test('handles empty array', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.process([]);
    expect(result).toEqual([]);
});

test('handles single element', () => {
    const result = moduleUnderTest.process([item]);
    expect(result.length).toEqual(1);
    expect(result[0]).toEqual(expectedTransformedItem);
});

test('handles many elements', () => {
    const manyItems = Array(100).fill(null).map((_, i) => createItem(i));
    const result = moduleUnderTest.process(manyItems);
    expect(result.length).toEqual(100);
});
```

### Error Test
```javascript
test('reports error for invalid input', () => {
    moduleUnderTest.operation('invalid');

    const result = moduleUnderTest.getErrors();

    expect(result.errors.length).toEqual(1);
    expect(result.errors[0].message).toEqual('exact error message');
    expect(result.errors[0].context).toEqual({line: 10});
});
```

### Skipped Bug Test with Minimal Reproduction
```javascript
test.skip('feature returns wrong value - BUG', () => {
    /*
     * BUG: Feature produces wrong output
     *
     * ROOT CAUSE: Wrong parameter used in calculation at line 42
     *
     * CODE LOCATION: src/module.js:42
     *
     * MINIMAL REPRODUCTION: Just call feature() with no setup
     *
     * CURRENT CODE:
     *   return calculate(param1, value);
     *
     * PROPOSED FIX:
     *   return calculate(param2, value);
     *
     * EXPECTED: "correct output"
     * ACTUAL:   "wrong output"
     */

    const result = moduleUnderTest.feature();

    expect(result).toEqual('correct output');
    // Actual: 'wrong output'
});
```

## Notes
- This workflow discovers bugs through systematic testing
- Skipped tests serve as regression tests for when bugs are fixed
- Focus on behavior verification, not implementation details
- Tests should be maintainable and readable by other developers
- Always read referenced files in the project to understand full context
- Bugs often appear in clusters - when you find one, look for more nearby
- Make your assertions match what your test titles claim to test
