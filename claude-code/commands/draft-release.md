## Context

- Latest release tags: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0`

## Your task

You are an AI assistant tasked with helping create a new release for a library. Your job is to review the changes made since the last release, draft a release title and description, and then create the release using the GitHub CLI once confirmed by the user.

Review the changes and make notes of significant updates, new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.

Next, draft a release title and description based on your review:

1. List all commits since the last release:
   <function_call>git log [LATEST_TAG]..HEAD --oneline</function_call>

2. For the title, use the format: "v[NEW_VERSION_NUMBER]". Increment the version number based on semantic versioning rules:
   - Major version for breaking changes
   - Minor version for new features
   - Patch version for bug fixes

s. For the description, organize the changes into sections:
   - üöÄ Features & Enhancements
   - üêõ Bug Fixes
   - üìñ Documentation
   - üì¶ Dependency updates

   Include brief, clear descriptions of each change, referencing relevant commit hashes or pull request numbers if available. Point out breaking changes.

Once you have drafted the release title and description, present them to the user for confirmation:

<output>
Proposed Release Title: [Your proposed title]

Proposed Release Description:
[Your proposed description]

Do you want to create this release? (yes/no)
</output>

Wait for the user's response. If the user confirms (answers "yes"), proceed with creating the release using the GitHub CLI:

1. Create the release:
   <function_call>gh release create [NEW_TAG] -d -t "[RELEASE_TITLE]" -n "[RELEASE_DESCRIPTION]"</function_call>

2. Confirm the release was created successfully:
   <function_call>gh release view [NEW_TAG]</function_call>

If at any point you encounter an error or are unable to complete a step, explain the issue to the user and ask for guidance.

Present your final output in the following format:

<release_summary>
Release Title: [The final release title]
Release Tag: [The new release tag]
Release Description:
[The final release description]

Release Status: [Successfully created / Failed to create (with reason)]
</release_summary>
