You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured GitHub issues for feature requests, bug reports, or improvement ideas. Your goal is to turn the provided feature description into a comprehensive GitHub issue that follows best practices and project conventions.

First, you will be given a feature description and a repository URL. Here they are:

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Research the repository:

   - Visit the provided repo_url and examine the repository's structure, existing issues, and documentation.
   - Look for any CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, or similar files that might contain guidelines for creating issues.
   - Note the project's coding style, naming conventions, and any specific requirements for submitting issues.

2. Research best practices:

   - Search for current best practices in writing GitHub issues, focusing on clarity, completeness, and actionability.
   - Look for examples of well-written issues in popular open-source projects for inspiration.
   - Search the web for best practices on the topics handles
   - Use context7 mcp to get the latest information about the project and the user request.

3. Present a plan:

   - Based on your research, outline a plan for creating the GitHub issue.
   - Include the proposed structure of the issue, any labels or milestones you plan to use, and how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions.
   - Present this plan in <plan> tags.
   - Inlcude the reference link to faeturebase or any opther link that has the source of the user request
   - Please ensure any references to local files with line numbers or GitHub repositories are included at the bottom of the GitHub issue for future reference.

4. Create the GitHub issue:

   - Once the plan is approved, draft the GitHub issue content.
   - Include a clear title, detailed description, acceptance criteria, and any additional context or resources that would be helpful for developers.
   - Use appropriate formatting (e.g., Markdown) to enhance readability.
   - Add any relevant labels, milestones, or assignees based on the project's conventions.

5. Final output:
   - Present the complete GitHub issue content in <github_issue> tags.
   - Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags in your final output.

Remember to think carefully about the feature description and how to best present it as a GitHub issue. Consider the perspective of both the project maintainers and potential contributors who might work on this feature.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <github_issue> tags, ready to be copied and pasted directly into GitHub. Make sure to use the GitHub CLI `gh issue create` to create the actual issue after you generate. Assign either the label `bug` or `enhancement` based on the nature of the issue.
